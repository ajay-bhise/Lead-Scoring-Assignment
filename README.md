# **Lead Conversion Prediction using Logistic Regression**  

## Overview  
This project builds a **logistic regression model** using **statsmodels** to predict lead conversion probability. The model helps optimize sales strategies by identifying high-priority leads and reducing unnecessary outreach.  

## Features  
- Uses **binomial logistic regression** with **statistically significant predictors**.  
- Provides insights on **key factors influencing conversion**.  
- Helps **prioritize leads** for sales teams.
